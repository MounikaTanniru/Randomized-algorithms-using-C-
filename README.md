# Randomized-algorithms-using-C-

This project is simple and intuitive. The code provides a platform for programmers to easily define and describe the structure, rules, and game flow of a card game and tic tac toe game.

## Description

Our code abstracts all turn-based card game concepts and simplifies the programming mechanics involved in coding a card game. For example, the concept of “cards” and “decks” is embedded into the language as fundamental data structures. Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is a board with n X n squares.
